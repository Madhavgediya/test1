                Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus
                have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some
                mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More
                sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The
                first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first
                semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor)
                and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and
                the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been
                increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted
                by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

                Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central
                processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory,
                typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical
                operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in retrieved. </div>

                    According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of computer was in a 1613 book called The
                    Yong Mans Gleanings by the English writer Richard Brathwait: "I haue [sic] read the truest computer of
                    Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number."
                    This usage of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or computations.
                    The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. During the latter part of
                    this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male
                    counterparts.[1] By 1943, most human computers were women.[2]
        
                    The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in the 1640s, meaning 'one who
                    calculates'; this is an "agent noun from compute (v.)". The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the use
                    of the term to mean "'calculating machine' (of any type) is from 1897." The Online Etymology Dictionary
                    indicates that the "modern use" of the term, to mean 'programmable digital electronic computer' dates from
                    "1945 under this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as Turing machine".[3]According to the Oxford
                    English Dictionary,index.html the first known use of computer was in a 1613 book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by the
